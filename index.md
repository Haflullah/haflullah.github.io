## About Me
I am an early-career Project Management professional with hands-on experience supporting Agile delivery, PMO coordination, and client-based digital transformation initiatives. My background combines structured project execution, stakeholder communication, and practical use of industry-standard tools across technical, operational, and service-oriented environments.

I have worked on delivery simulations, internal Agile teams, and client-facing projects, focusing on workflow management, backlog tracking, documentation, and delivery readiness. I am currently preparing for junior Project Management / PMO roles, with a long-term goal of building a sustainable project management career in the Dubai market.
